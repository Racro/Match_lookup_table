Instructions for running the code -
Create a new project.
Add the project3_TeamG.vhd and project3_Team_G_testbench.vhd files to the project.
Generate 2 Simple Dual Port RAM, one with width = 150 & depth = 128 and other with         width = 256 & depth = 1024 and FIFO (width = 128, depth = 1024) using IP Generator.
Run the Simulation.
